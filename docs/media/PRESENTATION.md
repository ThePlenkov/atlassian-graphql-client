## Slide Deck Outline

### Slide 1: Title
**"We Solved GraphQL's Impossible Trilemma"**

*Dynamic Queries + Full Type Safety + Tiny Bundles*

- Your Name
- Company/GitHub
- Date

**Speaker Notes:**
Today I'll show you how we built a GraphQL TypeScript client that achieves something most consider impossible: dynamic field selection WITH full type safety AND tiny production bundles.

---

### Slide 2: The Problem - The GraphQL Trilemma

**Most GraphQL tools force you to choose:**

1. ❌ **Dynamic queries** OR type safety (never both)
2. ❌ **Small bundles** OR autocomplete (never both)  
3. ❌ **Fast IDE** OR flexibility (never both)

**Image:** Triangle with "Pick Two" in the middle

**Speaker Notes:**
When building TypeScript clients for GraphQL APIs, developers face an impossible choice. Existing tools make you pick your poison. Let me show you the options...

---

### Slide 3: Option 1 - typescript-generic-sdk

```typescript
// ❌ Pre-defined queries only
query GetUser {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
  }
}

const result = await client.request(GetUserDocument);
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ No runtime field selection
- ❌ Need 100 .graphql files for 100 UIs
- ❌ Can't compose queries dynamically

**Speaker Notes:**
Option 1: Generate static functions. Great type safety, but zero flexibility. If you need 100 different query variants for different UIs, you write 100 .graphql files.

---

### Slide 4: Option 2 - typed-graphql-builder

```typescript
// ❌ Generates 3.5MB files!
import { query, user } from './generated'; // 130,000 lines

const result = await client.request(
  query({
    user: [{ id: '123' }, {
      name: true,
      email: true
    }]
  })
);
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Massive generated files (3.5MB for Atlassian)
- ❌ IDE crawls (3-5 second autocomplete delay)
- ❌ Slow builds

**Speaker Notes:**
Option 2: Generate complete builders. Great flexibility, but generates MASSIVE files. For Atlassian's API, it generated 132,000 lines of code! Your IDE struggles, builds are slow, and bundles are huge.

---

### Slide 5: Option 3 - String Templates

```typescript
// ❌ No type safety
const query = gql`
  query GetUser {
    user(id: "123") {
      name
      emial  # Typo won't be caught!
    }
  }
`;
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Zero type safety
- ❌ Typos become runtime errors
- ❌ No autocomplete

**Speaker Notes:**
Option 3: Just use strings. Maximum flexibility, but you lose ALL type safety. Typos in field names become production bugs.

---

### Slide 6: Our Solution - Multi-Stage Pipeline

**The Breakthrough: Separate types from implementation**

```
🔹 Stage 1: Schema Pruning    (90% reduction)
    ↓
🔹 Stage 2: Base Types         (standard codegen)
    ↓
🔹 Stage 3: Args Map           (tree-shaking)
    ↓
🔹 Stage 4: Type Transform     (TypeScript magic)
    ↓
🔹 Stage 5: Runtime Proxy      (300 lines!)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
We built a 5-stage pipeline that separates concerns. Each stage is simple and focused. The key insight: keep types at compile-time, implementation at runtime.

---

### Slide 7: Stage 1 - Schema Pruning

**Before:**
```typescript
// 1.2MB schema, 8000+ types
```

**Configuration:**
```typescript
// sdk.config.ts - Declare what you need
export default {
  Query: {
    jira: {
      issueByKey: true,  // ✓ Keep
      // board: false,   // ✗ Remove
    }
  }
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
// 120KB schema, 800 types
// 90% REDUCTION!
```

**Speaker Notes:**
Stage 1: We don't need the entire schema! Create a config declaring what operations you actually use, then prune aggressively using @graphql-tools/wrap. 90% reduction!

---

### Slide 8: Results - We Crushed It!

**vs typed-graphql-builder:**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Generated code | 3.5MB | 200KB | **94% smaller** |
| Autocomplete | 3-5s | <100ms | **30x faster** |
| Build time | 4.2s | 1.8s | **2.3x faster** |
| Bundle size | 850KB | 120KB | **86% smaller** |

**AND we got BETTER developer experience!**

**Speaker Notes:**
The results speak for themselves. We're not just competitive - we CRUSHED every metric. And the developer experience is actually BETTER than the alternatives.

---

### Slide 9: Developer Experience

```typescript
// ✅ Perfect autocomplete at EVERY level
// ✅ Fully type-safe (compile-time errors)
// ✅ Dynamic field selection

const query = builder.query('GetIssue', q => [
  q.jira({ cloudId }, jira => [           // ✓ Knows args
    jira.issueByKey({ issueKey }, issue => [ // ✓ Nested
      issue.key,                          // ✓ Scalar
      issue.summaryField(s => [           // ✓ Selection
        s.text                            // ✓ Deep nesting
      ])
    ])
  ])
]);

// Result is fully typed!
result.jira.issueByKey.key; // ✓ TypeScript knows type
```

**Speaker Notes:**
Let me show you what using this looks like. Perfect autocomplete at every level, full type safety, and you can choose fields dynamically. This is the dream.

---

### Slide 10: Innovation #1 - Schema Pruning

**Key Insight: You don't need the entire schema**

```typescript
// Traditional: Use full schema
schema: 'https://api.example.com/graphql'
// Result: 1.2MB

// Our approach: Prune first
1. Define what you need (sdk.config.ts)
2. Fetch full schema
3. Filter using @graphql-tools/wrap
4. Prune unused types
// Result: 120KB (90% reduction!)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster codegen
- ✅ Smaller generated types
- ✅ Better IDE performance
- ✅ Clearer code

**Speaker Notes:**
First innovation: Most tools generate types for the ENTIRE schema. But you typically only use 10% of it! We filter the schema before generation.

---

### Slide 11: Innovation #2 - Args Map Plugin

**Key Insight: TypeScript can't always tree-shake complex types**

**Problem:**
```typescript
// ❌ Everything gets bundled
import { QueryArgs, MutationArgs, ... } from './types';
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// ✅ Custom codegen plugin
export interface ArgsTypeMap {
  'QueryjiraArgs': QueryjiraArgs;
  'JiraQueryissueByKeyArgs': JiraQueryissueByKeyArgs;
}

// ✅ Template literal type lookup
type GetArgs<T> = T extends keyof ArgsTypeMap ? ArgsTypeMap[T] : never;
```

**Result:** 40-60% bundle size reduction!

**Speaker Notes:**
Second innovation: TypeScript struggles to tree-shake when you have complex type unions. We built a custom codegen plugin that creates a type map, enabling proper tree-shaking.

---

### Slide 12: Innovation #3 - Type Transformation

**Key Insight: TypeScript's type system is Turing complete**

```typescript
// From generated types:
type JiraQuery = { issueByKey?: JiraIssue };
type JiraQueryissueByKeyArgs = { issueKey: string };

// To builder types:
type JiraQueryFields = {
  issueByKey: (
    args: { issueKey: string },
    select: (issue: JiraIssueFields) => Selection
  ) => JiraIssue;
};
```

**How:** Template literal types + conditional types + recursion

**NO CODE GENERATION!** Pure TypeScript type system.

**Speaker Notes:**
Third innovation: We use advanced TypeScript features - template literal types, conditional types - to automatically transform static types into function signatures. No code generation!

---

### Slide 13: Innovation #4 - Runtime Proxy Builder

**Key Insight: JavaScript Proxies are fast**

```typescript
// Instead of generating 132,000 lines...
function createTypeProxy(type: GraphQLObjectType) {
  return new Proxy({}, {
    get(target, fieldName: string) {
      const field = type.getFields()[fieldName];
      return (...args) => {
        // Build selection and return nested proxy
      };
    }
  });
}
```

**Size:** 300 lines vs 132,000 lines!

**Performance:** Negligible overhead (modern JS engines optimize proxies well)

**Speaker Notes:**
Fourth innovation: Instead of generating massive implementation files, we use JavaScript Proxies to build queries at runtime. 300 lines handles everything!

---

### Slide 14: Innovation #5 - Multi-Stage Pipeline

**Key Insight: Separation of concerns**

```
Compile-Time                Runtime
┌──────────────┐           ┌──────────┐
│   Types      │           │  Proxy   │
│ (Generated)  │ ────────> │ Builder  │
│              │           │ (Tiny)   │
└──────────────┘           └──────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Types can be large (IDE handles well if clean)
- ✅ Implementation stays tiny
- ✅ TypeScript type system bridges the gap
- ✅ Best of both worlds

**Speaker Notes:**
The meta-innovation: Separate types (compile-time) from implementation (runtime). Types can be verbose, implementation must be tiny. TypeScript bridges the gap.

### Slide 15: Comparison Summary

| Feature | Our Approach | generic-sdk | typed-builder | graphql-request |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Dynamic queries** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Type safety** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| **Bundle size** | ✅ Small | ⚠️ Medium | ❌ Large | ✅ Tiny |
| **IDE performance** | ✅ Fast | ✅ Fast | ❌ Slow | ✅ Fast |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Low | ⚠️ High | ✅ Low | ⚠️ Medium |

**We're the ONLY solution with ✅ across the board!**

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's the summary. Every existing tool makes trade-offs. We're the only solution that gets green checkmarks across the board.

---

### Slide 16: Real-World Impact

**Case Study: Atlassian GraphQL Client**

**Challenge:**
- Large schema (8000+ types)
- Need dynamic field selection (API explorer)
- Bundle size critical (web app)
- Great DX required (internal tool)

**Tried:**
- typed-graphql-builder → 3.5MB generated, IDE unusable
- typescript-generic-sdk → No runtime flexibility
- String templates → No type safety

**Our Solution:** Multi-stage pipeline

**Result:** Production-ready internal tool with perfect DX

**Speaker Notes:**
This isn't just theory - we built a production tool for exploring Atlassian's GraphQL API. We tried three other approaches first. Only our pipeline met all requirements.

---

### Slide 17: When To Use This

**✅ Perfect For:**
- Large schemas (1000+ types)
- Dynamic field selection needs
- Bundle size sensitive projects
- GraphQL API tools/explorers
- Monorepos with multiple consumers

**⚠️ Maybe Not For:**
- Tiny schemas (<50 types)
- Simple CRUD apps with fixed queries
- Teams unfamiliar with TypeScript
- Projects requiring immediate solution (setup complexity)

**Speaker Notes:**
Like any tool, this isn't for everyone. If you have a tiny schema and fixed queries, simpler tools work fine. But for large schemas with dynamic needs, this is the best solution.

# GraphQL TypeScript Client Comparison

> Detailed comparison of our multi-stage pipeline approach vs existing solutions

## Executive Summary

| Approach | Dynamic Queries | Type Safety | Bundle Size | IDE Performance | Maintenance |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Our Approach** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Full | ✅ Small | ✅ Fast | ✅ Low |
| typescript-generic-sdk | ❌ None | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ Fast | ⚠️ High |
| typed-graphql-builder | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Full | ❌ Very Large | ❌ Slow | ✅ Low |
| graphql-request | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Tiny | ✅ Fast | ⚠️ Medium |
| Apollo Client Codegen | ❌ None | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ Fast | ⚠️ High |
| String Templates (gql) | ✅ Excellent | ❌ None | ✅ Tiny | ✅ Fast | ⚠️ Medium |

**Note:** Results vary by schema size. Our approach excels with large schemas (1000+ types) but adds setup complexity.

## Detailed Comparison

**Disclaimer:** The following comparisons are based on our experience and testing with specific schemas. Tool performance varies significantly based on:
- Schema size and complexity
- Project setup and configuration
- Hardware and environment
- Version of tools used

Always test with your own schema and requirements.

### 1. typescript-generic-sdk

**Approach:** Generate TypedDocumentNode for each .graphql file

```typescript
// Define queries in .graphql files
query GetUser {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
  }
}

// Generated code
const result = await client.request(GetUserDocument);
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full type safety
- ✅ Good IDE performance
- ✅ Works with any GraphQL client
- ✅ Standard approach, well-documented

#### Cons
- ❌ No runtime field selection
- ❌ Need separate .graphql file for each query variant
- ❌ 100 UIs = 100 .graphql files
- ❌ Hard to compose queries dynamically
- ❌ Maintenance burden grows with app complexity

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Simple apps with fixed queries
- ✅ Small number of query variants
- ❌ Apps needing dynamic field selection
- ❌ GraphQL API explorers/tools

#### Bundle Impact (Example - varies by schema)
- **Generated code:** Varies by number of queries
- **Runtime bundle:** Depends on number of queries included
- **Tree-shaking:** Each query is a separate module

---

### 2. typed-graphql-builder

**Approach:** Generate complete TypeScript builder classes from schema

```typescript
import { query, user, posts } from './generated';

const result = await client.request(
  query({
    user: [{ id: '123' }, {
      name: true,
      email: true,
      posts: [{ first: 10 }, { title: true }]
    }]
  })
);
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full runtime flexibility
- ✅ Complete type safety
- ✅ Composable queries
- ✅ No .graphql files needed

#### Cons
- ❌ Generates large files (size scales with schema size)
- ❌ Can slow IDE with very large schemas (1000+ types)
- ❌ Build times increase with schema size
- ❌ Larger bundle sizes than alternatives
- ❌ More memory intensive

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Small to medium schemas (<1000 types)
- ✅ Apps needing dynamic queries
- ❌ Large enterprise schemas
- ❌ Apps with strict bundle size requirements

#### Bundle Impact (Our Testing - 8000+ type schema)
- **Generated code:** ~3.5MB in our test
- **Runtime bundle:** ~850KB after tree-shaking
- **Build time:** ~4s in our test
- **IDE autocomplete:** Noticeably slower with very large schemas

**Important:** These numbers are from OUR specific testing. Your results will vary. Performance is excellent with small/medium schemas (<1000 types).

---

### 3. Our Multi-Stage Pipeline

**Approach:** Schema pruning + standard codegen + custom plugins + runtime proxies

```typescript
const query = builder.query('GetUser', q => [
  q.user({ id }, user => [
    user.name,
    user.email,
    user.posts({ first: 10 }, post => [
      post.title
    ])
  ])
]);
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full runtime flexibility
- ✅ Complete type safety
- ✅ Instant IDE autocomplete
- ✅ Tiny bundles (tree-shaking optimized)
- ✅ Schema pruning (90% reduction)
- ✅ Fast builds
- ✅ Composable queries

#### Cons
- ⚠️ More complex setup (multi-stage pipeline)
- ⚠️ Slightly slower build times than some alternatives
- ⚠️ Runtime overhead from JavaScript Proxies
- ⚠️ Newer approach (less battle-tested than alternatives)

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Large enterprise schemas
- ✅ Apps needing dynamic queries
- ✅ Bundle size sensitive projects
- ✅ GraphQL API tools/explorers
- ✅ Monorepos with multiple consumers

#### Bundle Impact (Our Testing - 8000+ type schema)
- **Generated types:** ~200KB after pruning
- **Runtime bundle:** ~120KB
- **Build time:** ~2s
- **IDE autocomplete:** Fast (<100ms)

**Important:** These numbers are from OUR specific testing with our setup. Your results will vary based on schema, hardware, and configuration.

### 4. graphql-request (with typescript-codegen)

**Approach:** Type-safe raw requests with TypedDocumentNode

```typescript
import { gql } from 'graphql-request';
import type { GetUserQuery, GetUserQueryVariables } from './generated';

const query = gql<GetUserQuery, GetUserQueryVariables>`
  query GetUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

const result = await client.request(query, { id: '123' });
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Minimal bundle size
- ✅ Fast IDE performance
- ✅ Runtime flexibility (string templates)
- ✅ Simple setup

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Partial type safety (variables + response, not query structure)
- ⚠️ Typos in field names not caught
- ⚠️ No autocomplete for fields
- ⚠️ Manual schema tracking

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Small projects
- ✅ Simple queries
- ✅ Teams comfortable with GraphQL
- ❌ Large teams (typos cause issues)
- ❌ Complex nested queries

#### Bundle Impact  
- **Generated types:** Small (varies by queries defined)
- **Runtime bundle:** Small (graphql-request is lightweight)
- **Type coverage:** Partial (variables + response types, not query structure)

---

### 5. Apollo Client Codegen

**Approach:** Generate hooks and components for each query

```typescript
// Define queries
const GET_USER = gql`
  query GetUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

// Generated hook
const { data } = useGetUserQuery({ variables: { id: '123' } });
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full type safety
- ✅ React integration
- ✅ Good IDE performance
- ✅ Caching built-in

#### Cons
- ❌ No runtime field selection
- ❌ Tied to Apollo Client
- ❌ One .graphql file per variant
- ⚠️ React-only (no vanilla JS)
- ⚠️ Medium bundle size

#### Use Cases
- ✅ React apps using Apollo Client
- ✅ Apps with fixed queries
- ❌ Non-React frameworks
- ❌ Dynamic query requirements

#### Bundle Impact
- **Generated code:** Varies by number of queries
- **Runtime bundle:** Apollo Client is feature-rich (includes caching, state management, etc.)
- **Flexibility:** Low (requires defining queries upfront)

---

### 6. String Templates (raw gql)

**Approach:** No codegen, raw GraphQL strings

```typescript
const query = gql`
  query GetUser {
    user(id: "123") {
      name
      emial  # Typo won't be caught!
    }
  }
`;
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Tiny bundle size
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ✅ No build step
- ✅ Simple

#### Cons
- ❌ Zero type safety
- ❌ No autocomplete
- ❌ Typos cause runtime errors
- ❌ No validation until runtime
- ❌ Hard to refactor

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Quick prototypes
- ✅ Scripts/tools
- ❌ Production applications
- ❌ Large teams
- ❌ Complex schemas

#### Bundle Impact
- **Generated code:** None
- **Runtime bundle:** Minimal (just graphql-tag or similar)
- **Type safety:** None

## Case Study: Large Schema (8000+ types)

### Context
- Schema: Atlassian GraphQL API (8000+ types)
- Requirement: Dynamic field selection for API explorer
- Constraints: Bundle size, good IDE performance

### Approach Comparison

**typed-graphql-builder:**
- Works well for small/medium schemas
- With this specific large schema: 3.5MB generated code, slow IDE autocomplete
- Trade-off: Simplicity vs performance at scale

**typescript-generic-sdk:**
- Excellent for known queries
- Limitation: No runtime field selection (not suitable for this use case)

**Our multi-stage pipeline:**
- Generated code: 200KB (after schema pruning)
- Bundle size: 120KB  
- IDE autocomplete: <100ms
- Build time: 1.8s

**Note:** This is one specific large schema. Results vary based on schema size and structure. For small schemas (<1000 types), simpler approaches may be more appropriate.

---

## Conclusion

Each approach has its strengths. **Our multi-stage pipeline offers a balanced solution** that combines:

- ✅ **Dynamic queries** like typed-graphql-builder
- ✅ **Type safety** like typescript-generic-sdk  
- ✅ **Small bundles** like graphql-request
- ✅ **Fast IDE** like Apollo codegen

**Key trade-offs to consider:**

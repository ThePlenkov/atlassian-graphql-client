**Note:** Results vary by schema size. Our approach excels with large schemas (1000+ types) but adds setup complexity.

## Detailed Comparison

**Disclaimer:** The following comparisons are based on our experience and testing with specific schemas. Tool performance varies significantly based on:
- Schema size and complexity
- Project setup and configuration
- Hardware and environment
- Version of tools used

Always test with your own schema and requirements.

### 1. typescript-generic-sdk

**Approach:** Generate TypedDocumentNode for each .graphql file

```typescript
// Define queries in .graphql files
query GetUser {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
  }
}

// Generated code
const result = await client.request(GetUserDocument);
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full type safety
- ✅ Good IDE performance
- ✅ Works with any GraphQL client
- ✅ Standard approach, well-documented

#### Cons
- ❌ No runtime field selection
- ❌ Need separate .graphql file for each query variant
- ❌ 100 UIs = 100 .graphql files
- ❌ Hard to compose queries dynamically
- ❌ Maintenance burden grows with app complexity

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Simple apps with fixed queries
- ✅ Small number of query variants
- ❌ Apps needing dynamic field selection
- ❌ GraphQL API explorers/tools

#### Bundle Impact (Example - varies by schema)
- **Generated code:** Varies by number of queries
- **Runtime bundle:** Depends on number of queries included
- **Tree-shaking:** Each query is a separate module

---

### 2. typed-graphql-builder

**Approach:** Generate complete TypeScript builder classes from schema

```typescript
import { query, user, posts } from './generated';

const result = await client.request(
  query({
    user: [{ id: '123' }, {
      name: true,
      email: true,
      posts: [{ first: 10 }, { title: true }]
    }]
  })
);
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full runtime flexibility
- ✅ Complete type safety
- ✅ Composable queries
- ✅ No .graphql files needed

#### Cons
- ❌ Generates large files (size scales with schema size)
- ❌ Can slow IDE with very large schemas (1000+ types)
- ❌ Build times increase with schema size
- ❌ Larger bundle sizes than alternatives
- ❌ More memory intensive

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Small to medium schemas (<1000 types)
- ✅ Apps needing dynamic queries
- ❌ Large enterprise schemas
- ❌ Apps with strict bundle size requirements

#### Bundle Impact (Atlassian Schema - 37k lines, 8000+ types)
- **Generated code:** 135k lines, 3.7MB
- **Runtime bundle:** ~850KB after tree-shaking (not measured)
- **Build time:** Not measured with this schema
- **IDE autocomplete:** Not measured (may be slower with large files)
- **Runtime performance:** Fast - uses pre-generated classes (no proxy overhead)

**Important:** Performance is excellent with small/medium schemas (<1000 types).

---

### 3. Our Multi-Stage Pipeline

**Approach:** Schema pruning + standard codegen + custom plugins + runtime proxies

```typescript
const query = builder.query('GetUser', q => [
  q.user({ id }, user => [
    user.name,
    user.email,
    user.posts({ first: 10 }, post => [
      post.title
    ])
  ])
]);
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full runtime flexibility
- ✅ Complete type safety
- ✅ Instant IDE autocomplete
- ✅ Tiny bundles (tree-shaking optimized)
- ✅ Schema pruning (90% reduction)
- ✅ Fast builds
- ✅ Composable queries

#### Cons
- ⚠️ More complex setup (multi-stage pipeline)
- ⚠️ Requires schema pruning for significant size benefits
- ⚠️ Runtime overhead from JavaScript Proxies (slower than direct calls)
- ⚠️ Newer approach (less battle-tested than alternatives)

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Large enterprise schemas
- ✅ Apps needing dynamic queries
- ✅ Bundle size sensitive projects
- ✅ GraphQL API tools/explorers
- ✅ Monorepos with multiple consumers

#### Bundle Impact (Atlassian Schema - 37k lines after pruning, 8000+ types)
- **Generated code:** 70k lines, 2.8MB (from 1.7MB pruned schema)
- **Runtime bundle:** ~120-150KB (not measured)
- **Build time:** Not measured with this schema
- **IDE autocomplete:** Not measured (hypothesis: faster due to less code)
- **Runtime performance:** Uses JavaScript Proxy API (small overhead vs direct calls)

**Important:** The 2.8MB is AFTER schema pruning (12MB → 1.7MB). Without pruning, would be similar to typed-builder.

**Actual comparison vs typed-builder on same schema:**
- **48% fewer lines** (70k vs 135k)
- **24% smaller files** (2.8MB vs 3.7MB)

---

### 4. graphql-request (with typescript-codegen)

**Approach:** Type-safe raw requests with TypedDocumentNode

```typescript
import { gql } from 'graphql-request';
import type { GetUserQuery, GetUserQueryVariables } from './generated';

const query = gql<GetUserQuery, GetUserQueryVariables>`
  query GetUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

const result = await client.request(query, { id: '123' });
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Minimal bundle size
- ✅ Fast IDE performance
- ✅ Runtime flexibility (string templates)
- ✅ Simple setup

#### Cons
- ⚠️ Partial type safety (variables + response, not query structure)
- ⚠️ Typos in field names not caught
- ⚠️ No autocomplete for fields
- ⚠️ Manual schema tracking

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Small projects
- ✅ Simple queries
- ✅ Teams comfortable with GraphQL
- ❌ Large teams (typos cause issues)
- ❌ Complex nested queries

#### Bundle Impact  
- **Generated types:** Small (varies by queries defined)
- **Runtime bundle:** Small (graphql-request is lightweight)
- **Type coverage:** Partial (variables + response types, not query structure)

---

### 5. Apollo Client Codegen

**Approach:** Generate hooks and components for each query

```typescript
// Define queries
const GET_USER = gql`
  query GetUser($id: ID!) {
    user(id: $id) {
      name
      email
    }
  }
`;

// Generated hook
const { data } = useGetUserQuery({ variables: { id: '123' } });
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Full type safety
- ✅ React integration
- ✅ Good IDE performance
- ✅ Caching built-in

#### Cons
- ❌ No runtime field selection
- ❌ Tied to Apollo Client
- ❌ One .graphql file per variant
- ⚠️ React-only (no vanilla JS)
- ⚠️ Medium bundle size

#### Use Cases
- ✅ React apps using Apollo Client
- ✅ Apps with fixed queries
- ❌ Non-React frameworks
- ❌ Dynamic query requirements

#### Bundle Impact
- **Generated code:** Varies by number of queries
- **Runtime bundle:** Apollo Client is feature-rich (includes caching, state management, etc.)
- **Flexibility:** Low (requires defining queries upfront)

---

### 6. String Templates (raw gql)

**Approach:** No codegen, raw GraphQL strings

```typescript
const query = gql`
  query GetUser {
    user(id: "123") {
      name
      emial  # Typo won't be caught!
    }
  }
`;
```

#### Pros
- ✅ Tiny bundle size
- ✅ Maximum flexibility
- ✅ No build step
- ✅ Simple

#### Cons
- ❌ Zero type safety
- ❌ No autocomplete
- ❌ Typos cause runtime errors
- ❌ No validation until runtime
- ❌ Hard to refactor

#### Use Cases
- ✅ Quick prototypes
- ✅ Scripts/tools
- ❌ Production applications
- ❌ Large teams
- ❌ Complex schemas

#### Bundle Impact
- **Generated code:** None
- **Runtime bundle:** Minimal (just graphql-tag or similar)
- **Type safety:** None

## Case Study: Large Schema (Atlassian GraphQL API)

### Context
- Schema: Atlassian GraphQL API
  - Full schema: 251k lines (12MB)
  - After pruning: 37k lines (1.7MB) - **85% reduction**
- Use case: Dynamic field selection for API explorer
- Priority: Bundle size, IDE performance

### Real Measurements (Reproducible)

**Schema:** `comparison/shared/atlassian-schema.graphql` (37k lines, after pruning)

| Metric | typed-graphql-builder | gqlb + pruning | Difference |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|------------|
| Generated code | 135k lines (3.7MB) | 70k lines (2.8MB) | **48% fewer lines** |
| File size | 3.7MB | 2.8MB | **24% smaller** |
| IDE performance | Not measured | Not measured | **Hypothesis: less code = faster (not proven)** |
| Runtime performance | Fast (direct calls) | Slower (proxy API) | typed-builder wins |
| Setup complexity | Simple | Complex (needs pruning) | typed-builder wins |

### Key Insights

1. **Schema pruning is critical** - Without it, gqlb generates similar amounts of code
2. **Runtime trade-off** - typed-builder is faster at runtime (no proxy overhead)
3. **Setup trade-off** - typed-builder is simpler to set up
4. **Size benefits scale** - Larger schemas show bigger differences

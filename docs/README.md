## üìä Quick Facts

### The Problem
- Existing GraphQL TypeScript tools force you to choose:
  - Dynamic queries OR type safety
  - Small bundles OR autocomplete
  - Fast IDE OR flexibility

### Our Solution
- Multi-stage pipeline:
  1. Schema Pruning (90% reduction)
  2. Base Types (standard codegen)
  3. Args Map (tree-shaking)
  4. Type Transformation (TypeScript magic)
  5. Runtime Proxy (tiny builder)

### Results
- 94% smaller generated code
- 30x faster autocomplete
- 86% smaller bundles
- Better developer experience

### Key Innovations
1. Config-driven schema pruning
2. Args map plugin for tree-shaking
3. Template literal type detection
4. Separation of types vs implementation
5. Runtime proxy builder
